# Notes for week 4 (dbt)
## analyses
- A place for SQL files that you don't want to expose
- I generally use it for data quality reports
- Lots of people don't use it

## dbt_project.yml
- The most important file in dbt
- Tell dbt some defaults
- You need it to run dbt commands
- For dbt core, your profile should match the one in the `.dbt/profiles.yml`

## macros
- They behave like Python functions (reusable logic)
- They help you encapsulate logic (in one place)

## README.md
- The documentation of your project
- Installation/setup guides
- Contact information

## seeds
- A place to upload csv and flat files (to add them to dbt later)
- Quick and dirty approach (better to fix at source)

## snapshots
- Take a picture of a table at a moment in time
- Useful to track the history of a column that overwrites itself

## tests
- A place to put assertions in SQL format
- A place for singulalr tests
- If this SQL command returns more than 0 rws, then dbt build fails

## models
- dbt suggests 3 subfolders:
### staging
- Sources (so raw table from database)
- Staging files are 1 to 1 copy of your data with minimal cleaning steps
    - Data types
    - Renaming columns
### intermediate
- Anything that is not raw nor you want to expose
- No guidelines, just for heavy duty cleaning or complex logic
### marts
- If it is in marts, it is ready for consumption by end users.
- Tables ready for dashboards.
- Properly models, clean tables.
